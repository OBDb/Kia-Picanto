generations:
  - name: "First Generation (SA)"
    start_year: 2004

    description: "The original Kia Picanto (sold as the Morning in South Korea) was introduced as Kia's entry-level city car. Featuring a tall, boxy design typical of small cars from that era, it emphasized interior space efficiency and ease of urban use. Available primarily as a five-door hatchback, though a three-door variant was offered in some markets. Powertrain options included small-displacement petrol engines, typically 1.0L and 1.1L units, with modest power outputs focused on efficiency rather than performance. The interior was basic but practical, with a straightforward dashboard design and durable materials. This generation established the Picanto as Kia's smallest model globally, offering affordable transportation with surprising space efficiency and practicality for its tiny footprint."

  - name: "Second Generation (TA)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The second-generation Picanto featured more sophisticated styling under the direction of Peter Schreyer, with the brand's emerging 'tiger nose' grille and more dynamic proportions. Available in both three-door and five-door body styles, it offered more visual variety than its predecessor. Engine options remained small-displacement units, typically 1.0L and 1.2L petrol engines, but with improved efficiency and refinement. Some markets also received a bi-fuel LPG variant. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and feature content, with available options including Bluetooth connectivity, a sunroof, and LED lighting. This generation elevated the Picanto from a basic transportation device to a more refined and desirable small car that could appeal to buyers who chose the segment for its merits rather than just budget constraints."

  - name: "Third Generation (JA)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Picanto features more assertive styling with a sportier stance, more pronounced character lines, and a more confident interpretation of Kia's 'tiger nose' grille. Available primarily as a five-door hatchback, with the sportier GT-Line and X-Line variants offering unique styling elements. Built on a new platform with increased use of high-strength steel, it offers improved structural rigidity, safety, and refinement. Engine options remain small-displacement units, typically 1.0L (including a turbocharged option in some markets) and 1.2L petrol engines, with manual or automatic transmission options. The interior represents a major step forward with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design, and technology features uncommon in the A-segment, including an available 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Safety features have been enhanced with the availability of autonomous emergency braking and other driver assistance systemsâ€”rare offerings in this segment. This generation maintains the Picanto's city-friendly dimensions while offering levels of refinement, technology, and safety that challenge larger vehicles, positioning it as a premium offering in the A-segment rather than merely an entry-level option."
